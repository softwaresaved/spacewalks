# Spacewalks

## Overview
Spacewalks is a Python analysis tool for researchers to generate visualisations and statistical summaries of NASA's extravehicular activity datasets.

## Features
Key features of Spacewalks:

- Generates a CSV table of summary statistics of extravehicular activity crew sizes
- Generates a line plot to show the cumulative duration of space walks over time

## Pre-requisites

Spacewalks was developed using Python version 3.12.

To install and run Spacewalks you will need have Python3 installed.
You will also need the following libraries (minimum versions in brackets):

- [NumPy](https://www.numpy.org/) >=2.0.0 - Spacewalk's test suite uses NumPy's statistical functions
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html) >=3.0.0  - Spacewalks uses Matplotlib to make plots
- [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/8.2.x/#) >=8.2.0  - Spacewalks uses Pytest for testing
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) >= 2.2.0 - Spacewalks uses Pandas for data frame manipulation

## Installation instructions

- Clone the Spacewalks repository to your local machine using Git.
If you don't have Git installed, you can download it from the official Git website.

```
git clone https://github.com/your-repository-url/spacewalks.git
cd spacewalks
```

- Install the necessary dependencies:
```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- To ensure everything is working correctly, run the tests using Pytest.

```
python3 -m pytest
```

## Usage Example

To run an analysis using the `eva_data_analysis.py` script from the command line terminal, do:

```
# Usage Examples
python3 eva_data_analysis.py data/eva-data.json results/eva-data.csv
```

The first argument is path to the JSON data file.
The second argument is the path the CSV output file.

If the code runs successfully, you should get the resulting plot in `results/cumulative_eva_graph.png`
